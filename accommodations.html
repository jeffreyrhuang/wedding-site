          <h2 class="headline">HOTEL</h2><br/>
          <p><img src="images/hotel.jpg" class="mapicon">  There are many hotels in the area. It is possible to find hotels to fit all requirements and budgets within a 15 minute radius of the airport. We have selected one nearby hotel that we believe fits all our needs: <a href="http://www.hotelmartino.com" target="_blank">Martino Resort and Spa</a>.  This hotel is located 15 minutes from the airport and 8 minutes from the wedding site. It is a 5-star hotel with full amenities: free wifi, comfortable rooms with AC and balconies, swimming pool, Italian restaurant, beautiful gardens and tour services with “Expeditions Tropicales,” one of the best tour companies in the country (you can look at the available tours and book early if you wish <a href="http://www.expedicionestropicales.com" target="_blank">here</a>). For your information we will be staying at this hotel the nights before and after the wedding. We will have a shuttle from this hotel to the wedding site and back for your convenience. We have negotiated a great price for our wedding party:  $90 (cash) or $100 (credit card) per night per room for single or double occupancy. <strong>To book your reservation, please email the hotel at martino@racsa.co.cr. Please specify the dates you arrive and depart, and mention you are attending the "Boda Huang Ramirez".  We already asked the hotel to set aside a block of rooms but it is still advisable to book as soon as possible to make sure you get the reservation.</strong></p>

          <h2 class="headline top-padding">POINTS OF INTEREST</h2><br/>
          <p>Please take a look at <a href="images/map.png" target="_blank"><b>this map!</b></a></p>
          <h3>Map Legend</h3>
          <p><img src="images/avion.jpg" class="mapicon"><b>  AIRPORT:</b>  This is the main international airport (SJO or <a href="http://www.fly2sanjose.com" target="_blank">Aeropuerto Juan Santa María)</a> in Costa Rica. It is located 30 minutes from downtown San José. If taking a cab look for the red cabs and avoid the pricier orange cabs. It is also possible to arrange a shuttle to pick you up at the airport.</p>
          <p><img src="images/town.jpg" class="mapicon"><b>  ALAJUELA:</b>  Alajuela is one of Costa Rica’s 7 provinces and its capital, also called Alajuela, has everything a main city would have, even though it looks more like a town. For more information check out this <a href="http://costarica.com/alajuela" target="_blank">website</a>.
          <p><img src="images/wedding.png" class="mapicon"><b>  WEDDING SITE:</b></br></p>
          <div class="indent">
            <p><b>Location:</b> The wedding will take place at a family-owned <em>quinta</em> in La Garita of Alajuela, 20 minutes from Juan Santa María International Airport, 1 hour away from the nearest beach on the Pacific coast, 1 hour from Po&aacute;s Volcano and relatively close to many other touristic attractions.</p>
            <p><b>Weather:</b> La Garita is known for its perfect weather. In March (dry season/summer) we can expect no rain, no wind, and temperatures between 70 and 88 F. (Note that the weather in downtown San Jose will be between 62 and 82 F and if you plan to go to a volcano or higher up place it will be cooler)</p>
            <p><b>The <em>Quinta:</em></b> The property has a beautiful mountain view, as well as lots of flowering plants and tropical trees including orange, lime, cas, mango, avocado and even Costa Rica’s national tree: the Guanacaste tree (known for its big shade). We will serve fresh juice from the produce on the <em>quinta</em>, so if you have never tried cas for instance this is your chance :)</p>
            <p><b>What to bring:</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Comfortable shoes. This will be an outdoor semiformal wedding, therefore we recommend that ladies not wear stilettos since we will be stepping on grass most of the time.</li>
              <li>Light comfortable clothes</li>
              <li>Sunscreen and/or hats</li>
              <li>Be ready to party and relax!</li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p><img src="images/food.png" class="mapicon">  <b>FOOD:</b> There are several traditional food restaurants in the area, as well as other cuisines. We have highlighted two of these restaurants. “Fiesta del Maíz" (Corn Party) is a restaurant that features Costa Rican traditional dishes which use corn as their main ingredient. “Delicias de mi Tierra” (Delights of my Land) is another Costa Rican traditional cuisine experience. Highly recommended.</p>
          <p><img src="images/zooave.png" class="mapicon">  <b>ZOO AVE:</b> An animal park that specializes in wildlife rescue, rehabiliation, release, and conservation.  They also have canopy ziplining. More information can be found <a href="http://rescateanimalzooave.org/" target="_blank">here</a>. Note that the spanish version of the website is more presentable than the english version.</p>
          <p><img src="images/orchid.png" class="mapicon">  <b>BOTANICAL ORCHID GARDEN:</b> A beautiful botanical orchid garden that lets you experience orchid life throughout different settings such as tropical trails, varied gardens, exhibition spots, learning nurseries and more. More information can be found <a href="http://www.orchidgardencr.com/home.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

          <h2 class="headline top-padding">TRAVEL TIPS</h2><br/>
          <p><b>Currency:</b> Even though US dollars and credit cards are widely accepted in tourist locations in Costa Rica, you will probably need some colones (local currency) to pay for cabs and other smaller purchases.  The most convenient option is to exchange for them right in the airport near the baggage claim, but you will get a poor exchange rate. You can also exchange money at the banks in Alajuela Center, where you will get a  better rate – you just need to present your passport when you exchange your dollars.</p>
